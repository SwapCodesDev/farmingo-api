{
  "Blight": {
    "Cause": "Fungal disease (often Exserohilum turcicum) affecting maize leaves, surviving on crop residue and spreading by wind or rain-splash.",
    "Symptoms": "Long, cigar-shaped grey-green to tan lesions on leaves, running parallel to leaf margins; lesions may coalesce to kill leaf tissues.",
    "Precautions": [
      "Remove or bury infected plant debris after harvest.",
      "Use resistant hybrids and avoid continuous maize cropping.",
      "Ensure good air circulation and avoid prolonged leaf wetness."
    ],
    "Cure": {
      "Chemical": [
        "Apply foliar fungicide (e.g., propiconazole) at early symptoms.",
        "Repeat spray at recommended intervals when weather conditions favour disease."
      ],
      "Organic": [
        "Use crop rotation with non-host crops.",
        "Encourage residue decomposition and avoid heavy inoculum build-up."
      ]
    }
  },
  "Common Rust": {
    "Cause": "Fungal disease caused by Puccinia sorghi; spores travel by wind and infect maize under cool, wet conditions.",
    "Symptoms": "Small, circular to elongated brown-reddish pustules (urediniospores) on both leaf surfaces; may develop yellow halo; in severe cases leaf chlorosis and death.",
    "Precautions": [
      "Select resistant hybrids and plant early to avoid peak spore arrival.",
      "Maintain good field hygiene, eliminate alternate hosts if present.",
      "Monitor crop regularly during humid/cool periods."
    ],
    "Cure": {
      "Chemical": [
        "Apply fungicide when pustules first appear and conditions favour spread.",
        "Use products with multiple modes of action to prevent resistance."
      ],
      "Organic": [
        "Maintain crop vigor with proper nutrition and irrigation to reduce susceptibility.",
        "Remove heavily infected plants if feasible to reduce inoculum."
      ]
    }
  },
  "Gray Leaf Spot": {
    "Cause": "Fungal disease caused by Cercospora zeae‑maydis or Cercospora zeina; survives on maize residue and flourishes under warm humid conditions and poor tillage.",
    "Symptoms": "Tan to brown rectangular lesions on lower leaves, parallel to veins; as disease progresses lesions turn greyish, elongate, and may cover entire leaves.",
    "Precautions": [
      "Use crop rotation and reduce conservation tillage to lower residue-borne inoculum.",
      "Select hybrids with resistance, avoid continuous maize cropping.",
      "Ensure proper spacing and ventilation; protect leaf area during grain-fill."
    ],
    "Cure": {
      "Chemical": [
        "Apply foliar fungicide before large lesion development when disease pressure is high.",
        "Ensure timely fungicide applications aligned with disease progression."
      ],
      "Organic": [
        "Manage crop residue (bury or remove) to reduce inoculum load.",
        "Improve plant health via balanced fertilisation and irrigation to reduce disease severity."
      ]
    }
  },
  "Healthy": {
    "Cause": "No infection or physiological disorder detected; crop is growing under optimal conditions.",
    "Symptoms": "Uniform green leaves, proper fruit/cob set, no visible lesions, spots or discoloration.",
    "Precautions": [
      "Maintain balanced nutrition and irrigation schedule.",
      "Inspect regularly for early signs of disease or pests.",
      "Keep tools and equipment clean; practise proper field hygiene."
    ],
    "Cure": {
      "Chemical": [
        "No treatment required; maintain preventive fungicide/insecticide schedule if local risk is high."
      ],
      "Organic": [
        "Use organic amendments and compost to strengthen crop resilience.",
        "Adopt integrated pest/disease management practices routinely."
