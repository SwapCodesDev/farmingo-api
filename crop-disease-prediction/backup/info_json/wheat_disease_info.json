  "BlackPoint": {
    "Cause": "A condition (often fungal-associated) in wheat kernels where the embryo end becomes dark brown to black; favoured by high humidity, delayed harvest or harvest-moisture stress. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}",
    "Symptoms": "Dark brown to black discoloration at the embryo end of kernels; shrivelled or degraded grain quality; may reduce seed germination. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}",
    "Precautions": [
      "Harvest promptly and avoid delays when grain moisture remains high.",
      "Use well-drained and ventilated storage to avoid fungal colonisation. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}",

    "Cause": "Fungal disease complex often involving species of Fusarium (e.g., Fusarium graminearum) causing root, crown or foot rot in wheat, especially under continuous cropping, dry soil stress and residue-borne inoculum. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}",
    "Symptoms": "Dark brown lesions on stem base or sub-crown internode; plants stunted or prematurely dying; patches of weakened plants in field. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}",
    "Precautions": [
      "Rotate crops and avoid continuous wheat on same field.",
      "Use well-drained soils and avoid drought or seedbed stress at emergence.",

      "Chemical": [
        "Use seed treatment fungicides designed for root/foot-rot pathogens."

      "Use certified disease-free seed and avoid fields with history of blast.",

        "Chemical control is limited; fungicide applied at heading may reduce severity but is not wholly reliable."
