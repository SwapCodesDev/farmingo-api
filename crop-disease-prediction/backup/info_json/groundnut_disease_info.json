  "ALTERNARIA LEAF SPOT": {
    "Cause": "Fungal disease caused by Alternaria spp., favoured by warm, humid conditions and poor field hygiene.",
    "Symptoms": "Small brown to dark brown spots on leaves which enlarge and develop concentric ring patterns; may lead to defoliation if severe.",
    "Precautions": [
      "Use disease-free seed and clean planting material.",
      "Ensure good crop rotation and destroy infected plant debris.",
      "Maintain optimal spacing and avoid dense canopy to reduce humidity."
    ],
    "Cure": {
      "Chemical": [
        "Apply fungicides (e.g., chlorothalonil, mancozeb) at early appearance of spots.",
        "Repeat at recommended intervals under high disease pressure."
      ],
      "Organic": [
        "Use neem oil or plant‐derived antifungal sprays as preventive measure.",
        "Increase soil organic matter and use compost teas to improve plant defence."
      ]
    }
  },
  "HEALTHY": {
    "Cause": "No disease or pest stress detected; plant is under favourable growth conditions.",
    "Symptoms": "Uniform green foliage, normal leaf size and shape, no spots or lesions, and good pod set.",
    "Precautions": [
      "Maintain balanced fertilisation and irrigation schedule.",
      "Inspect field regularly for early signs of disease or pest attack.",
      "Keep tools and equipment clean to avoid introducing pathogens."
    ],
    "Cure": {
      "Chemical": [
        "No treatment needed; focus on preventive schedule."
      ],
      "Organic": [
        "Apply organic manure or vermicompost to maintain soil health.",
        "Use neem or other botanical sprays periodically as a preventive measure."

  "LEAF SPOT (EARLY AND LATE)": {
    "Cause": "Fungal diseases: Early leaf spot caused by Cercospora arachidicola and Late leaf spot caused by Cercosporidium personatum. These pathogens survive on crop residue and infect under warm, humid or wet conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}",
    "Symptoms": "Lesions appear on lower leaves first. Early leaf spot: brown circular spots with yellow halo; Late leaf spot: dark brown to black spots, often on both surfaces, may have tufts of spores underneath. Defoliation can occur when leaves coalesce. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}",
    "Precautions": [
      "Rotate groundnut with non-host crops and bury or remove infected residue.",
      "Use resistant varieties if available, avoid continuous groundnut cropping.",
      "Ensure proper spacing, reduce leaf wetness by irrigating appropriately."
    ],
    "Cure": {
      "Chemical": [
        "Apply foliar fungicides (e.g., chlorothalonil, tebuconazole) at first signs and during favourable weather for disease.",
        "Follow label instructions and alternate modes of action to avoid resistance."
      ],
      "Organic": [
        "Use bio-fungicides or compost‐based sprays early in disease cycle.",
        "Maintain plant vigour through good nutrition so plants better withstand infection."
      ]
    }

  "ROSETTE": {
    "Cause": "Viral disease complex known as Groundnut rosette disease; transmitted by aphids (e.g., Aphis craccivora) and often associated with satellite RNAs. Particularly damaging in sub-Saharan Africa. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}",
    "Symptoms": "Severe stunting, yellowing or chlorosis of leaves, bushy appearance, malformed pods or no pods in young plants. High yield losses possible. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}",
    "Precautions": [
      "Use resistant or tolerant cultivars and control aphid vectors early.",
      "Remove volunteer plants and alternate host plants that may harbour the virus.",
      "Maintain plant health through balanced nutrition and avoid stress."
    ],
    "Cure": {
      "Chemical": [
        "No specific antiviral chemicals; focus is on vector control and cultural methods."
      ],
      "Organic": [
        "Use reflective mulches or barrier crops to reduce aphid landing.",
        "Encourage natural enemies of aphids and maintain plant vigour with organic amendments."

  "RUST": {
    "Cause": "Fungal disease called Puccinia arachidis (groundnut rust); thrives in warm, humid conditions and causes major yield losses. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}",
    "Symptoms": "Reddish to orange pustules appear on the undersides of leaves, later turning brown; severe infection leads to leaf drop, reduced photosynthetic area and smaller pods.",
    "Precautions": [
      "Use rust‐resistant varieties where available and apply effective crop rotation.",
      "Avoid overlapping groundnut cropping, manage volunteer plants, ensure good field hygiene.",
      "Apply fungicide preventively when weather is favourable for rust development."
    ],
    "Cure": {
      "Chemical": [
        "Apply appropriate foliar fungicides according to local recommendations when pustules first appear.",
        "Repeat as required when weather is hot, wet and disease pressure is high."
      ],
      "Organic": [
        "Spray biocontrol fungicides or botanical extracts early in the crop cycle.",
        "Maintain plant health with good organic nutrient supply to reduce susceptibility."
