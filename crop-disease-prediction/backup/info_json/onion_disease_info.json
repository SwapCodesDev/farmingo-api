  "Iris yellow virus": {
    "Cause": "Viral disease caused by Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV), transmitted by onion thrips (Thrips tabaci). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}",
    "Symptoms": "Yellow to straw-colored elongated lesions on leaves and scapes; diamond-shaped flecks; reduction in bulb size and yield. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}",
    "Precautions": [
      "Use virus-free or certified seed material and avoid fields with volunteer onions or alternate Allium hosts.",
      "Control onion thrips populations and remove weeds/alternate hosts near the field.",
      "Maintain good fertility and avoid plant stress (especially avoid excess nitrogen which may favour thrips). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}"

    "Cure": {
      "Chemical": [
        "No direct cure for the virus once plant is infected; focus on vector control (thrips) and preventive fungicide/insecticide-based programs."
      ],
      "Organic": [
        "Encourage natural predators of thrips, use reflective mulches or barrier crops to reduce landing of vectors.",
        "Maintain healthy crop growth via organic compost and avoid plant stress so plants better tolerate infection."

  "healthy": {
    "Cause": "No disease or major stress detected; plant growing under favourable conditions.",
    "Symptoms": "Uniform green leaves, normal bulb and shoot development, no spots, lesions or deformities.",
    "Precautions": [
      "Maintain balanced irrigation and nutrient schedule appropriate for onion.",
      "Regularly inspect plants for early signs of pests, diseases or nutrient imbalances.",
      "Sanitise tools and equipment; rotate crops away from Allium for at least 2-3 years when possible. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}"

      "Chemical": [
        "No specific treatment required; preventive management only."

  "leaf blight": {
    "Cause": "Foliar fungal disease such as Botrytis leaf blight (caused by Botrytis squamosa) or Stemphylium leaf blight (caused by Stemphylium vesicarium), often following stress or other disease initiation. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}",
    "Symptoms": "Initial small white or tan spots with halo on leaves turning into coalesced necrotic areas, leaf tip die-back, loss of photosynthetic area and smaller bulb size. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}",
    "Precautions": [
      "Remove old debris and volunteer onions; practise crop rotation with non-Allium crops for 2-3 years. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}",
      "Avoid dense plantings and overhead irrigation; ensure good airflow and minimise leaf wetness duration. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}",
      "Use certified seed and avoid planting in fields with heavy Allium debris or known disease history."

    "Cure": {
      "Chemical": [
        "Apply foliar fungicides as per local label for Botrytis or Stemphylium leaf blight when first symptoms appear; rotate modes of action. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}"

        "Use biological fungicides and ensure good field hygiene.",

    "Cause": "Fungal disease caused by Purple blotch (Alternaria porri) and sometimes in complex with Stemphylium spp.; favoured by warm, humid conditions and leaf injury. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}",
    "Symptoms": "Water-soaked spots on leaves that quickly develop white or grey centre, then brown to purple lesions with purple halo; can girdle leaves causing die-back and affect bulb quality. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}",
    "Precautions": [
      "Use pathogen-free seed and plant in well-ventilated fields; avoid high humidity and long leaf-wetness periods. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}",
      "Avoid mechanical injury to leaves and minimise thrips damage which predisposes to infection. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}",

      "Chemical": [
        "Apply fungicides effective against Alternaria and Stemphylium (e.g., mancozeb, chlorothalonil) at early symptoms and repeat under favourable conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}"

      "Organic": [
        "Use neem oil or other botanical sprays early; maintain plant vigour and avoid stress conditions.",
