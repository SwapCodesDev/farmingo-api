  "Cereal Grain molds": {
    "Cause": "Complex of fungal pathogens (e.g., Fusarium spp., Alternaria spp., Curvularia spp.) infecting sorghum grain during flowering and grain‐fill, especially under warm humid or rainy conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}",
    "Symptoms": "Grains become discoloured (white, pink, grey or black), low grain quality and viability; panicles may show moldy growth. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}",
    "Precautions": [
      "Use mould‐free seed, harvest promptly when maturity is reached.",
      "Avoid late flowering under humid conditions; ensure good air circulation around panicles.",
      "Rotate sorghum with non‐host crops and manage residues."

      "Chemical": [
        "Apply appropriate seed treatments and fungicide sprays at flowering if high risk identified."

  "Covered Kernel smut": {
    "Cause": "Fungal disease caused by smut fungi that replace kernels with masses of spores, often in kernels covered by plant tissues. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}",
    "Symptoms": "Kernels appear normal until heading, then swell and become covered by a membrane containing dark spore masses; infected grains may burst at harvest.",
    "Precautions": [
      "Use certified seed and treat seed before planting.",
      "Avoid planting in infested fields repeatedly; rotate crops with non‐hosts.",
      "Sanitise equipment and remove infected crop debris."

      "Chemical": [
        "Seed treatment with systemic fungicide effective against smut organisms."

  "Head Smut": {
    "Cause": "Fungal disease (e.g., Sphacelotheca reiliana) affecting sorghum panicles where the inflorescence is replaced by smut mass of spores. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}",
    "Symptoms": "Panicles are distorted or replaced by black powdery spore masses; may appear at maturity as dark smutty heads instead of normal grain heads.",
    "Precautions": [
      "Use resistant varieties and treat seed with recommended fungicide.",

    "Cause": "Fungal disease (for example caused by Colletotrichum graminicola) which can cause both leaf spot (anthracnose) and red‐rot of stalks under warm, humid conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}",
    "Symptoms": "Leaves show small red or purple spots that expand; stalks internally show red/orange discoloration and may rot, causing lodging and reduced yield.",
    "Precautions": [
      "Use resistant hybrids where available.",
      "Rotate crops and manage crop debris; ensure good drainage and avoid excessive nitrogen that favors disease.",
      "Inspect stalks at harvest for early detection of internal rot."
    ],
    "Cure": {
      "Chemical": [
        "Foliar fungicide application during early disease onset; systemic fungicides for stalk rot may be applied if local guidelines allow."
      ],

    "Precautions": [
      "Plant resistant varieties and monitor crop regularly during humid periods.",
      "Avoid dense plantings; ensure good airflow and remove volunteer hosts.",
      "Fungicide sprays may be timed when pustules first appear or weather favours spread."

      "Chemical": [
        "Apply foliar fungicides with proven efficacy against rust when threshold reached."

    "Symptoms": "Inflorescence or grain head appears initially normal then bursts open at maturity releasing loose black spores; affected plants may be stunted and yield reduced.",
    "Precautions": [
      "Use certified disease‐free seed and treat dated seed with suitable fungicide before planting.",
